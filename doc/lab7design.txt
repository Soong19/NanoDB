CS122 Assignment 7 - Write-Ahead Logging - Design Document
==========================================================

A:  Write-Ahead Logging
-----------------------

A1.  One of your tasks this week was to implement the TransactionManager's
     forceWAL(LogSequenceNumber) method.  This method must perform its
     operation atomically and durably, so that if a crash occurs during this
     method, the WAL will always be a reliable record of database operations.
     How did you ensure that your implementation satisfies these constraints?
     Justify your approach.  (You can assume that the underlying OS provides
     an atomic file-sync operation, and that writing a single sector will
     also be atomic with the obvious caveat that the written sector may still
     be buffered until a sync occurs.)
LH:  1. Write all records of pages first
     2. Update the next LSN and write the whole meta-data page
     Atomicity: OS guarantees writing meta-data page is atomic, while the
                redundant records do not matter at all.
     Duration:  All changes are performed at stable storage device.

A2:  Another task was to implement the beforeWriteDirtyPages() method on the
     TransactionManager.  Your implementation must ensure that the write-ahead
     logging rule is always followed.  What steps do you take to ensure this
     will always happen?  Describe your method's approach.
LH:  1. Traverse all dirty pages to be written, find the max LSN
     2. Write all log records before max LSN to disk, using forceWAL()

A3:  Actually, if you think about it, NanoDB writes to data pages before it
     emits WAL records describing the changes to those pages.  At a higher level
     than for the previous question, explain how your implementation ensures
     that NanoDB follows the WAL rule e.g. when a new tuple is being inserted or
     updated on a heap file's data page.  Your answer should touch on all major
     subsystems that are involved in this operation.
LH:  For example, when a tuple is inserted on a heap file's data page, NanoDB
     will record the changes of the page (and might header page). WAL will not
     be performed until the page is going to be evicted. If the page is evicted,
     the event-handler will notice TransactionManager to tell it write log
     records first.

A4:  In your current implementation, some pages may not have corresponding
     LSNs associated with them, because they are not logged in the write-ahead
     log.  Enumerate all file types that will have pages not logged in the
     WAL.
LH:  1. WAL file page  => log file
     2. Txn State page => atomic write
     3. BTree page     => some bugs

B:  The txnstate.dat File
-------------------------

B1.  The txnstate.dat file records the next transaction ID that the database
     should use when it is restarted.  Why is it important for this to be
     stored and used by the database when it is restarted?
LH:  NanoDB uses transaction ID to identify transactions so that rollback &
     redo/undo work well.

B2:  The txnstate.dat file records a "firstLSN" value, which is where recovery
     processing starts from.  What guarantees are made about this firstLSN
     value?  Given these guarantees, will redo processing need any records
     before the firstLSN value?  Will undo processing need any records before
     the firstLSN value?  Justify your answers.
LH:  guarantees:
        * All records have been performed to disk
        * All transactions before firstLSN have finished (committed or aborted).
     No, all records are performed.
     No, all transactions are done.

B3:  Currently, the "firstLSN" value is only moved forward when recovery
     processing is completed.  Can you describe a strategy for moving forward
     firstLSN during normal operation?  What constraints must be enforced to
     ensure the database continues working properly?  Explain your answers.
LH:  Since NanoDB is single-thread database, we can just move forward firstLSN
     after a done transaction.
     constraints:
        * Before moving firstLSN, all WAL changes has been written to disk
        * When moving firstLSN, cannot do anything else => some delay after done
          transaction done

B4:  The txnstate.dat file's "firstLSN" value is somewhat similar to a
     checkpoint / fuzzy-checkpoint, but it is not quite the same.  Describe
     the differences between what NanoDB provides, and how checkpoints
     generally work, focusing on what constraints must be enforced during the
     checkpointing operation, vs. the constraints that NanoDB must enforce
     with firstLSN.
LH:  The main difference is: firstLSN guarantees all stale transactions are done,
     but checkpoint not. => In checkpoint's undo phase, NanoDB needs to turn
     back to determine whether there are any uncommitted transactions.

C:  Testing
-----------

C1:  Did you run into any fun, surprising or crazy bugs while you were
     debugging your transaction-processing code?  (It's OK if your answer
     is "no," although Donnie will be dubious...)
LH:  Conceptual understanding is hard, but I finally figure it out.

D:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

D<i>:  <one-line description>

     <brief summary of what you did, including the specific classes that
     we should look at for your implementation>

     <brief summary of test-cases that demonstrate/exercise your extra work>

E:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK!  Thoughtful and constructive input will help us to
improve future versions of the course.  These questions are OPTIONAL, and
your answers will not affect your grade in any way (including if you hate
everything about the assignment and databases in general, or Donnie and/or
the TAs in particular).  Feel free to answer as many or as few of them as
you wish.

E1.  What parts of the assignment were most time-consuming?  Why?

E2.  Did you find any parts of the assignment particularly instructive?
     Correspondingly, did any parts feel like unnecessary busy-work?

E3.  Did you particularly enjoy any parts of the assignment?  Were there
     any parts that you particularly disliked?

E4.  Were there any critical details that you wish had been provided with the
     assignment, that we should consider including in subsequent versions of
     the assignment?

E5.  Do you have any other suggestions for how future versions of the
     assignment can be improved?
