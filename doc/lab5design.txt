CS122 Assignment 5 - Advanced Subqueries - Design Document
==========================================================

A:  Subquery Planning
---------------------

A1.  Which planner did your team add subquery planning to?  How easy or
     difficult was it to incorporate subquery-planning into the planner?

A2.  Briefly outline the process by which you perform subquery planning in
     your query planner.  Also explain briefly how your subquery-planner works.

A3.  Briefly describe how you detect whether there are subqueries in the
     GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.  How do you make sure this doesn't
     interfere with subqueries in other clauses?

B:  Correlated Evaluation
-------------------------

B1.  How easy or difficult was it to incorporate support for correlated
     evaluation into your query planner?  Did it affect the sequence of
     steps in any substantial ways?

D:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

D<i>:  <one-line description>

     <brief summary of what you did, including the specific classes that
     we should look at for your implementation>

     <brief summary of test-cases that demonstrate/exercise your extra work>
