This package contains the abstractions for supporting simple functions,
aggregate functions, and table-returning functions in NanoDB.  Additionally,
this package contains many function implementations to use in SQL queries,
as well as a {@link FunctionDirectory} for looking up function implementations
from within the query planning and evaluation code.
</p>

<p>Here is a brief description of the abstractions implemented in NanoDB.</p>

<ul>

<li>All kinds of functions derive from the abstract {@link Function} base
    class.</li>

<li>"Simple functions" take zero or more arguments, and produce one result for
    each set of inputs.  They may be deterministic or nondeterministic, and
    they may access or maintain state data.  All simple functions derive from
    the {@link SimpleFunction} class.</li>

<li>"Aggregate functions" take a multiset of inputs, and produce one aggregate
    result from that multiset of inputs.  Currently, aggregate functions only
    accept one multiset (e.g. <tt>AVG(n)</tt>).  All aggregate functions
    derive from the {@link AggregateFunction} class.</li>

<li>Both simple functions and aggregate functions derive from the
    {@link ScalarFunction} class, since both of them return a single result
    value, and both can appear in expressions.</li>

<li>"Table functions" take zero or more arguments, and return a result-set of
    zero or more tuples.  Table functions have an interface similar to the
    plan-node interface so that tuples can be produced one at a time, and
    other details such as schema and costing details can be exposed by the
    function.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Function Naming</h2>

<p>
All function names are uppercase.
</p>

<p>
Aggregate functions may support the <tt>DISTINCT</tt> keyword, e.g.
"<tt>SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a) FROM t;</tt>".  In NanoDB, these invocations
are mapped to a function invocation with "<tt>#DISTINCT</tt>" appended to
the specified function name.  For example, the example SQL will result in
NanoDB resolving the invocation to the "<tt>COUNT#DISTINCT</tt>" function.
